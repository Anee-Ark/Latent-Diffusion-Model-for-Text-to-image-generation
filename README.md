# Latent Diffusion Model for Text-to-Image Generation

This repository contains the implementation of a **Latent Diffusion Model** for generating images from textual descriptions. The project demonstrates the use of fine-tuned and pre-trained models such as **CLIP**, **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, and **U-Net** using the **Diffusers Library**.

## Introduction

The project utilizes a **latent diffusion framework** to generate images conditioned on textual prompts. It integrates several components to achieve this:

- **CLIP Model**: For encoding text and image features.
- **VAE**: Compresses high-resolution images into a latent space for efficient computation.
- **U-Net**: Performs denoising in the latent space during the diffusion process.

**Objective**: Generate high-quality images that align semantically with textual descriptions.

## Dataset

### Dataset Used

- **Flickr8k**:
  - Contains 8,000 images paired with human-generated captions.
  - Used for training and evaluating the model.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Resized to a fixed dimension for compatibility with the models.
   - Converted to tensor format.
   
2. **Caption Tokenization**:
   - Tokenized using Hugging Face's **CLIP Tokenizer**.
   - Ensured truncation to fit model input size.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Model Components

1. **CLIP Model**:
   - Fine-tuned to improve text-to-image alignment.
   - Used for embedding textual descriptions into latent space.

2. **VAE**:
   - Encodes images into a compressed latent representation.
   - Decodes generated latent representations back into image space.

3. **U-Net**:
   - Handles the denoising process during diffusion.

4. **Diffusion Process**:
   - Simulates the generation process by gradually refining random noise into a meaningful image conditioned on text embeddings.

## Training Procedure

### Steps

1. **Fine-Tuning CLIP**:
   - Trained on the Flickr8k dataset to align text and image embeddings.
   - Loss function: **Contrastive Loss** to minimize the distance between related embeddings.

2. **Training Parameters**:
   - **Batch Size**: 8
   - **Learning Rate**: 1e-5
   - **Epochs**: 5

3. **Saving Models**:
   - Fine-tuned models saved to disk for reuse.

### Tools and Frameworks

- **PyTorch**: Core framework for model training.
- **Hugging Face Diffusers**: Provides pre-built components for latent diffusion.
- **CUDA**: GPU acceleration for faster training.
